# Supercharge Minecraft mod
This mod is designed to make Minecraft more fast-paced and somewhat more difficult. It changes the following things about the base game:
- Redstone, lapis, iron, gold, emerald, diamond and coal are now all way more common in the overworld and in caves
- Mob kills give you 4 times as much experience
- Zombies, creepers, spiders, skeletons, endermen, vindicators and ravagers spawn more frequently in the overworld and in caves
- Various mobs give you loot 100% of the time, and you get more loot per mob kill
