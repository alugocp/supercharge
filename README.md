# Supercharge Minecraft mod
This mod is designed to make Minecraft more fast-paced and somewhat more difficult. It changes the following things about the base game:
- Adds way more ore in world generation
- Boosts the drop rates for enemies
- Enemy kills give you 4x the experience
- Way more enemies spawn
